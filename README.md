# cse435project
This is the project website for the Active Park Assist project for CSE435 class at Michigan State University.  The links
found on the website feature all of the artifacts turned in for this project.  This is a group project taught by Dr. Betty
Cheng.  Our group will participate in a requirements engineering exercise with Ford Motor Company.  Helping us with our
project at Ford will be Eileen Davidson.  Our task was to generate a Requirements Document for an Active Park Assist in-vehicle
system.  We were also tasked with building a website and presenting/demonstrating our finished project.

To run a simulation of our system, navigate to the "About" tab, and the click on "Prototype v2".
